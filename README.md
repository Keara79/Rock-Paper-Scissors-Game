feat: Add Rock Paper Scissors game

This commit adds a Rock Paper Scissors game to the project. The game allows users to play against the computer and make their choices of rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's choice is generated randomly. 

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. It compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors. The result is displayed on the webpage, indicating whether the user won, lost, or it's a tie.

This feature enhances the interactivity and entertainment value of the project. Users can now enjoy playing the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors right in their browser.
